# chrr_measure_calcs
This repository is a work in progress. It contains code to replicate some measures for the [County Health Rankings & Roadmaps 2025 data release](https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/health-data).

You will find:

 - R code in .qmd and .Rmd files for calculating most measures
 - A few SAS scripts for specific measures only
 - Complete datasets for the 2025 release

If you prefer data or calculations in a different format, if there's a particular measure you need that isn't yet included, or if you have questions, please feel free to reach out via the [Discussions tab](https://github.com/County-Health-Rankings-and-Roadmaps/chrr_measure_calcs/discussions).

We can also be reached via email at **info@countyhealthrankings.org**
