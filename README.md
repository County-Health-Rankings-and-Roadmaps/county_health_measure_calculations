# chrr_measure_calcs
This repository is a work in progress. It contains code to replicate measures for the [2025 County Health Rankings & Roadmaps data release]([url](https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/health-data)).

It includes:

 - R code in .qmd and .Rmd files.
 - A few SAS scripts for specific measures.

If you prefer the code in a different format, if there's a particular measure you need that isn't yet included, or if you have questions about the data, please feel free to reach out via the Discussions tab.

We can also be reached via email at info@countyhealthrankings.org
