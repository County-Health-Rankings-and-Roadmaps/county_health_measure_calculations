# chrr_measure_calcs
This repository is a work in progress and contains code to replicate measures for the [2025 County Health Rankings & Roadmaps data release]([url](https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/health-data)).

It includes:

 - R code in .qmd and .Rmd files.
 - A few SAS scripts for specific measures.

If you prefer the code in a different format or if there's a particular measure you need that isn't included, please feel free to reach out via the Discussions tab.

For any questions about the data or if you need further clarification, don't hesitate to us via info@countyhealthrankings.org
