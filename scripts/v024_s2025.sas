/*v024 - Children in Poverty
author: MB; 

/* Description: Percentage of people under age 18 in poverty. 
Numerator: The numerator is the number of people under age 18 living in a household whose income is below the poverty level. Poverty status is defined by family; either everyone in the family is in poverty or no one in the family is in poverty. The characteristics of the family used to determine the poverty threshold are: number of people, number of related children under 18, and whether or not the primary householder is over age 65. Family income is then compared to the poverty threshold; if that family’s income is below that threshold, the family is in poverty.
Denominator: The total number of people under age 18 in a country. */
