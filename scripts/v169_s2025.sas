/*Data sources:

-	State (StateIndicatorsDatabase_2025.xlsx) and district-level (DistrictCostDatabase_2025.xlsx) data are available and can be downloaded from this link: https://www.schoolfinancedata.org/download-data/
    For the Data Release 2025, SFID was late in publicly releasing the data; we received the raw data via email, however the data are now publicly accessible at the link above. 
	Note some discrepancies were found between the data we received via email and the data available from schoolfinanacedata.com as of March 2025. 

-	NCES school data, leauniverse2021_2022.sas7bdat, is available in the inputs folder: chrr_measure_calcs/inputs/leasuniverse2021_2022.sas7bdat 

-	STATE FIPS data, state_fips.sas7bdat, is available in the inputs folder: chrr_measure_calcs/inputs/state_fips.sas7bdat

-	COUNTY FIPS WITH CONNECTICUT OLD, county_fips_with_ct_old.sas7bdat, is available in the inputs folder: chrr_measure_calcs/inputs/county_fips_with_ct_old.sas7bdat 

/*Note: Counties 53013 and 36071 were suppressed due to significant changes from the previous year identified during verification.*/

/*
1.	Clean the dataset by only including the following columns:
    ?	leaid (District ID)
    ?	year
    ?	predcost
    ?	ppcstot (note: the requested data sent via email has a column called ?spend?. We need to rename the column to ?ppcstot?. 

2.	Subset the data with year=2022 (note: the requested data sent via email only has 2022 data)

3.	Calculate the funding gap for each district: fundinggap=ppcstotpredcost 

4.	Import the cleaned v169_raw_district.xlsx to sas and save as ?v169_raw_district.sas7bdat?*/
